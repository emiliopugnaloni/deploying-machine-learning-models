We have the .cicleci folder in top. This are configs necesary to run thisng in circleci
We have Jobs and Workflows
we have some ENV variables that are used in the config.yml file We ned to set them in the circleci project settings
Then we have Gemfury in model-package of section 07. This is to publish model
We have a publish_model step in the .tox of model_package

The puslibsh_model is not something to put to much atention. But there we are builiding our package with wheel

In the cicleci/congi:
The test and upload regression mode will run only when we create a tag in github.
It a specific thing that we can trigger in git. And it gives a differnce from a nomral pull-req, or a normal merge to maseter branch

First we are going to fecth the data from kaggle
Then we can run the test (this is done with the tox commands). We are doing more test (get data, publish package to gemfury)
And the last part is publish our model

In summary, our workflows would be that in our model package we would make some changes, then we uupdate the model_pakage/regression_model/trained_models/VERSION string,
open a pull request, the test would run, we merge the pullrequest and create a tag, and that would trigger a publish job.


....


To run everything, we need to establish env variables in circleci project settings
